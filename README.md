# Rolling Coin
Rolling Coin is a bathymetric surface manipulation method develped to help automated depth contour generation. Currently there are two different versions of the method:


## Rolling Coin V1:
This version of the method takes depth model as input and exports an abstraction of the original depth model surface containing only the depth contour limits. Optionally also creates raw (vector-) contours. Raw contours will most likely need post-processing in order to get cartographically satisfying results (not included in the script).


## Rolling Coin V2:
This version creates a manipulated 2.5 dimensional depth model surface. The method is navigationally safe â€“ exported surface is never deeper than the original surface. The modified surface can be used to automatically create vector contours or user can choose to continue to apply other surface smoothing methods in order to be able to create even better quality contours from the surface.


## Notes:
- Written in Python (Python 2)
- Provided scripts are simple proof-of-concept scripts, not fully developed production line tools
- There is no user interface and the scripts are not guaranteed to work
- User should read the script sources carefully to get familiar with the method and the source code lines that one needs to modify before use


## Dependencies:
1. GDAL
   - See www.gdal.org
   - File I/O
   - Contouring (optional, V1 only)
2. NumPy
   - See www.numpy.org
   - Provides 2D arrays to store grid data
3. (Optional, in V1 only:) GeoPandas
   - See http://geopandas.org


## Basic functionality (V2):
- *Coin* is a 2 dimensional neighborhood matrix of boolean values and can be of any shape and size
- Script assumes input data to have *negative depths* below vertical reference level
- In order to maintain the desired *Coin* shape it is recommended to have the input data in projected CRS and to use identical spatial resolution in both (x-, y-) directions

### Algorithm in a nutshell:
1. Open input depth model
   - Get original *No Data* value
   - Get *georeferencing parameters*
   - Save input depth model data to a 2D NumPy array
   
2. *Apply a 3 * 3 cell focal maximum filter* to expand shoals by one cell to all directions
   - This will ensure navigational safety of raw contours (assuming the input depth model is safe for navigation)
   
3. Create another 2D NumPy array to hold manipulated surface values
   - We'll call this array __*"export array"*__
   - Initialize all *export array* cell values to 10000 (meters)
   
4. Create a __*Coin*__

5. *For each cell* in original data array:
   - Find shoalest depth (*Zmax*) of neighborhood (*Coin*)
   - Write *Zmax* to *export array* cell __if *Zmax* is deeper__ than current depth of *export array* cell
   - *Note that the export array cell values can only get deeper from the initial value: the Coin is always trying to get maximum depth.*

6. Restore original *No Data* values to *export array*

7. Export modified surface (*export array*) to a file
